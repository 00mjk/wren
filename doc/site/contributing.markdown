It should be obvious by now that Wren is under active development and there's
lots left to do. I'd be delighted to have your help.

Wren uses the OSI-approved [MIT license][mit]. I'm not sure exactly what that
means, but I went with the most permissive license I could find.

The source is developed [on GitHub][github]. My hope is that the codebase,
tests, and documentation are easy to understand and contribute to. If they
aren't, that's a bug. If you're looking for somewhere to get started, try
writing some example programs in Wren and see what rough spots you run into.
You can also look through to code for `// TODO` or help improve
[these docs][docs].

If you have questions, feel free to [file an issue][issue] or email me
(`robert` at `stuffwithstuff.com`).
