It should be obvious by now that Wren is under active development and there's lots left to do. I'd be delighted to have your help.

Wren uses the OSI-approved [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). I'm not sure exactly what that means, but I went with the most permissive license I could find.

The source is developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/munificent/wren). My hope is that the codebase, tests, and documentation are easy to understand and contribute to. If they aren't, that's a bug. If you're looking for somewhere to get started, try writing some example programs in Wren and see what rough spots you run into. You can also look through to code for `// TODO` or help improve [these docs](https://github.com/munificent/wren/tree/master/doc/site).

If you have questions, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/munificent/wren/issues) or email me (`robert` at `stuffwithstuff.com`).
