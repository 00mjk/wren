^title Community

Like the [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren), Wren's community is small,
but it exists!

## User group

There's one Wren user group, and it's the [official Wren mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wren-lang). Please join it and
say hello! There are no strangers to Wren, just friends we haven't met yet.

## Libraries

There are some third-party libraries that are written in Wren. Here's the list:

- [Please](https://github.com/EvanHahn/wren-please): An assertion library.
- [wren-colors](https://github.com/gsmaverick/wren-colors): Print colored
  messages to the terminal.
- [wren-test](https://github.com/gsmaverick/wren-test): A testing framework.
- [wren-vector3d](https://github.com/EvanHahn/wren-vector3d): 3D vectors.
